! Main input
Switzerland		! name of the river/basin/region
SIO      		! name/ID of the air temperature station
2011			! name/ID of the water temperature station
c				! type of series: c=continuous series, m=mean year
1d        		! time resolution: 1d=daily, nw=n weeks (n=1,2,...), 1m=monthly
8           	! version: 3,4,5,7,8 parameters
0				! Threshold temperature for ice formation
RMS				! objective function: RMS (Root Mean Square Error), NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Index), KGE (Kling-Gupta Efficiency Index)
RK4          	! mod_num : numerical method used to solve the model equation EUL (Euler Explicit), RK2 (Runge-Kutta 2), RK4 (Runge-Kutta 4), CRN (Crank Nicolson)
PSO            	! optimization algorithm: PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) or RANSAM (Random Sampling)
0.60			! minimum percentage of data: 0...1. E.g., when using 1m time resolution, the monthly average is set to NaN when available data during one month are less than this percentage (60% in this case)    
500				! n_run: number of iterations
-999			! minimum efficiency index (i.e., RMS, NSE, KGE). All model realization with efficiency index greater than this threshold are saved in file 0_...
